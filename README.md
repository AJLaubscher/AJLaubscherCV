 Curriculum Vitae

 This project is dedicated to showcase my personal online and interactive curriculum Vitae.

 The goals for this project is to recreate and restyle my conventional CV to be used on my next project which will be to create an online portfolio.

 The curruculum vitae will be typed and formatted mainly in HTML and CSS.

The structure and layout of this single page is of top priority while adding extra functionality with interactive and clickable links to aid visual appeal.

Structuring of the document:
    The page must represent a typical rectangular format CV which can be created through word processers. 

    Boxes/containers will be used to structure the CV.

    The following must be present:
        1. Profile picture
        2. Interactive/ Clickable social links (GitHub, LinkedIn, Email)
        3. General information (Spoken languages, Drivers licence code, City location)
        4. Personal Summary (Boasting), short and sweet
        5. Skills and hobbies
